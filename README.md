# My rofi config

This is my local config for [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi).

## Usage examples

- [Reopen windows, open applications and useful URLs in combi mode](https://github.com/vncsmyrnk/gnome-config/blob/c65a0224da4717cef5005f5aad57e906d8601c39/keybindings.conf#L23)
- [Listing tmux sessions and switching to them](https://github.com/vncsmyrnk/gnome-config/blob/c65a0224da4717cef5005f5aad57e906d8601c39/keybindings.conf#L28)

## Install

This project uses [just](https://github.com/casey/just) and [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) for the installation.

```bash
just install
```

Considering `rofi` is already installed, you can just run:

```bash
just config
```
